**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

The evolution of software engineering has been marked by several key milestones that have significantly shaped the field. Here are three pivotal moments:

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
Event: The NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.

Description: This conference is often cited as the birthplace of the term "software engineering." Before this event, software development was more of an ad-hoc process, lacking formal methods and practices. The conference highlighted the "software crisis"—the problems associated with growing software complexity, project overruns, and unreliable systems. The term "software engineering" was introduced to advocate for applying engineering principles to software development to improve its reliability and manageability. This milestone marked the beginning of efforts to formalize and professionalize software development practices.

2. The Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s)
Event: Publication of "Structured Programming" by Edsger Dijkstra and other influential works.

Description: Structured programming emerged as a response to the challenges of managing complex software systems. Edsger Dijkstra's work on structured programming emphasized the use of control structures (like loops and conditionals) and avoiding the use of "goto" statements. This approach improved code clarity and maintainability by promoting the use of modular and hierarchical structures. The principles of structured programming laid the foundation for later developments in software engineering, including object-oriented programming and modern software design methodologies.

3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)
Event: The publication of the Agile Manifesto.

Description: The Agile Manifesto, created by a group of software developers in 2001, revolutionized software development by introducing a new set of values and principles aimed at improving flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), prioritize iterative development, adaptive planning, and active customer involvement. This approach contrasted sharply with traditional, rigid methodologies like the Waterfall model. Agile has since become a dominant paradigm in software development, helping teams respond more effectively to changing requirements and delivering higher-quality software.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to software development that outlines the stages involved in creating a software application. While different models exist, a commonly used framework includes the following phases:
